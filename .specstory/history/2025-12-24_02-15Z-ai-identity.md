I'm Auto, an agent router designed by Cursor. I help with coding tasks in your workspace.

I can:

what can you do

_**Agent (model default, mode Ask)**_

I can help with:

## Code Understanding & Analysis
- **Read files** — examine any file in your workspace
- **Search codebase** — semantic and text search to find functions, classes, or patterns
- **Analyze code** — explain how code works, find bugs, suggest improvements
- **Navigate code** — trace function calls, understand architecture

## Code Assistance
- **Write code** — functions, classes, components, tests
- **Refactor** — improve structure, readability, performance
- **Debug** — identify and fix issues
- **Documentation** — add comments, READMEs, docstrings

## Project Management
- **Architecture** — design patterns, structure
- **Dependencies** — manage packages, versions
- **Configuration** — setup files, build configs

## Current Limitations (Ask Mode)
You're in **ask mode** (read-only). I can:
- Read and analyze your code
- Provide code suggestions
- Answer questions about your codebase

To apply changes directly, switch to **agent mode**.

I see you're working on an antigravity-vscode extension with chat history readers for multiple AI providers (Trae, Codebudy, Cursor, etc.). What would you like help with?
